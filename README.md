# Laravel Testing 101
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Laravel Testing 101. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

![Laravel Testing 101][lil-thumbnail-url] 

An integral part of Laravel development is testing what has been coded. Automated testing is the most reliable form of testing, and one that often causes confusion to the junior developerâ€”especially regarding where to start. In this course, Ana Lisboa guides you through writing tests, testing a Laravel app, and understanding where to start testing and what needs to be tested. She also goes over API testing, test coverage, and more.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:
